# python-challenge homework
Assistance and resources used:
1. Xpert Learning Assistant - Provided examples on Python concepts like dictionaries, loops and code structure (speficially greatest increase and decrease in profits).
2. Rewatched previous recorded Python classes
3. VBA homework- applied similar logic that I used for the VBA homework
4. Chatgpt- helped with debugging and correcting errors in my code structure.  Helped explain concepts in detail that I was missing.

PyBank took me the longest to figure out, but once I did, writing PyPoll went smoother
